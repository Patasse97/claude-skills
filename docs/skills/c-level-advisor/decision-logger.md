Two-layer memory system. Layer 1 stores everything. Layer 2 stores only what the founder approved. Future meetings read Layer 2 only â€” this prevents hallucinated consensus from past debates bleeding into new deliberations.

## Keywords

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1 â€” Raw Transcripts
**Location:** `memory/board-meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md`
- Full Phase 2 agent contributions, Phase 3 critique, Phase 4 synthesis
- All debates, including rejected arguments
- **NEVER auto-loaded.** Only on explicit founder request.
- Archive after 90 days â†’ `memory/board-meetings/archive/YYYY/`

### Layer 2 â€” Approved Decisions
**Location:** `memory/board-meetings/decisions.md`
- ONLY founder-approved decisions, action items, user corrections
- **Loaded automatically in Phase 1 of every board meeting**
- Append-only. Decisions are never deleted â€” only superseded.
- Managed by Chief of Staff after Phase 5. Never written by agents directly.

## Decision Entry Format

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] â€” [AGENDA ITEM TITLE]

**Decision:** [One clear statement of what was decided.]
**Owner:** [One person or role â€” accountable for execution.]
**Deadline:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Review:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Rationale:** [Why this over alternatives. 1-2 sentences.]

**User Override:** [If founder changed agent recommendation â€” what and why. Blank if not applicable.]

**Rejected:**
- [Proposal] â€” [reason] [DO_NOT_RESURFACE]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] [Action] â€” Owner: [name] â€” Due: [YYYY-MM-DD] â€” Review: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Supersedes:** [DATE of previous decision on same topic, if any]
**Superseded by:** [Filled in retroactively if overridden later]
**Raw transcript:** memory/board-meetings/[DATE]-raw.md
```

---

## Conflict Detection

Before logging, Chief of Staff checks for:
1. **DO_NOT_RESURFACE violations** â€” new decision matches a rejected proposal
2. **Topic contradictions** â€” two active decisions on same topic with different conclusions
3. **Owner conflicts** â€” same action assigned to different people in different decisions

When a conflict is found:
```
âš ï¸ DECISION CONFLICT
New: [text]
Conflicts with: [DATE] â€” [existing text]

Options: (1) Supersede old  (2) Merge  (3) Defer to founder
```

**DO_NOT_RESURFACE enforcement:**
```
ðŸš« BLOCKED: "[Proposal]" was rejected on [DATE]. Reason: [reason].
To reopen: founder must explicitly say "reopen [topic] from [DATE]".
```

---

## Logging Workflow (Post Phase 5)

1. Founder approves synthesis
2. Write Layer 1 raw transcript â†’ `YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md`
3. Check conflicts against `decisions.md`
4. Surface conflicts â†’ wait for founder resolution
5. Append approved entries to `decisions.md`
6. Confirm: decisions logged, actions tracked, DO_NOT_RESURFACE flags added

---

## Marking Actions Complete

```markdown
- [x] [Action] â€” Owner: [name] â€” Completed: [DATE] â€” Result: [one sentence]
```

Never delete completed items. The history is the record.

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ decisions.md       # Layer 2: append-only, founder-approved
â”œâ”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md  # Layer 1: full transcript per meeting
â””â”€â”€ archive/YYYY/      # Raw files after 90 days
