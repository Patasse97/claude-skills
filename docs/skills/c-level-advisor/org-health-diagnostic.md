## Scoring & Traffic Lights

Each dimension is scored 1-10 with traffic light:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green (7-10):** Healthy â€” maintain and optimize
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow (4-6):** Watch â€” trend matters; improving or declining?
- ðŸ”´ **Red (1-3):** Action required â€” address within 30 days

**Overall Health Score:**
Weighted average by company stage (see `references/health-benchmarks.md` for weights).

## Dimension Interactions (Why One Problem Creates Another)

| If this dimension is red... | Watch these dimensions next |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Financial Health | People (freeze hiring) â†’ Engineering (freeze infra) â†’ Product (cut scope) |
| Revenue Health | Financial (cash gap) â†’ People (attrition risk) â†’ Market (lose positioning) |
| People Health | Engineering (velocity drops) â†’ Product (quality drops) â†’ Revenue (churn rises) |
| Engineering Health | Product (features slip) â†’ Revenue (deals stall on product) |
| Product Health | Revenue (NRR drops, churn rises) â†’ Market (CAC rises; referrals dry up) |
| Operational Health | All dimensions degrade over time (execution failure cascades everywhere) |

TOP PRIORITIES
ðŸ”´ [1] People: attrition at 24% â€” engineering velocity will drop in 60 days
   Action: CHRO + CEO to run retention audit; target top 5 at-risk this week
ðŸŸ¡ [2] Revenue: pipeline coverage at 1.8x â€” Q+1 miss risk is high
   Action: CRO to add 3 qualified opps within 30 days or shift forecast down
ðŸŸ¡ [3] Engineering: tech debt at 30% of sprint â€” shipping will slow by Q3
   Action: CTO to propose debt sprint plan; COO to protect capacity

WATCH
â†’ People â†’ Engineering cascade risk if attrition continues (see dimension interactions)

## Graceful Degradation

You don't need all metrics to run a diagnostic. The tool handles partial data:
- Missing metric â†’ excluded from score, flagged as "[data needed]"
- Score still valid for available dimensions
- Report flags which gaps to fill for next cycle
