## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Framework

**Formula:**
```
RICE Score = (Reach Ã— Impact Ã— Confidence) / Effort
```

**Components:**

| Component | Description | Values |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Reach** | Users affected per quarter | Numeric count (e.g., 5000) |
| **Impact** | Effect on each user | massive=3x, high=2x, medium=1x, low=0.5x, minimal=0.25x |
| **Confidence** | Certainty in estimates | high=100%, medium=80%, low=50% |
| **Effort** | Person-months required | xl=13, l=8, m=5, s=3, xs=1 |

**Example Calculation:**
```
Feature: Mobile Push Notifications
Reach: 10,000 users
Impact: massive (3x)
Confidence: medium (80%)
Effort: medium (5 person-months)

RICE = (10,000 Ã— 3 Ã— 0.8) / 5 = 4,800
```

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
- **1000+**: High priority - strong candidates for next quarter
- **500-999**: Medium priority - consider for roadmap
- **100-499**: Low priority - keep in backlog
- **<100**: Deprioritize - requires new data to reconsider

**When to Use RICE:**
- Quarterly roadmap planning
- Comparing features across different product areas
- Communicating priorities to stakeholders
- Resolving prioritization debates with data

**RICE Limitations:**
- Requires reasonable estimates (garbage in, garbage out)
- Doesn't account for dependencies
- May undervalue platform investments
- Reach estimates can be gaming-prone

### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
                  Low Effort          High Effort
                +--------------+------------------+
   High Value   |  QUICK WINS  |    BIG BETS      |
                |  [Do First]  |   [Strategic]    |
                +--------------+------------------+
   Low Value    |   FILL-INS   |   TIME SINKS     |
                |   [Maybe]    |    [Avoid]       |
                +--------------+------------------+
```

**Quadrant Definitions:**

| Quadrant | Characteristics | Action |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Quick Wins** | High impact, low effort | Prioritize immediately |
| **Big Bets** | High impact, high effort | Plan strategically, validate ROI |
| **Fill-Ins** | Low impact, low effort | Use to fill sprint gaps |
| **Time Sinks** | Low impact, high effort | Avoid unless required |

**Portfolio Balance:**
- Ideal mix: 40% Quick Wins, 30% Big Bets, 20% Fill-Ins, 10% Buffer
- Review balance quarterly
- Adjust based on team morale and strategic goals

---

### MoSCoW Method

| Category | Definition | Sprint Allocation |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Must Have** | Critical for launch; product fails without it | 60% of capacity |
| **Should Have** | Important but workarounds exist | 20% of capacity |
| **Could Have** | Desirable enhancements | 10% of capacity |
| **Won't Have** | Explicitly out of scope (this release) | 0% - documented |

**Decision Criteria for "Must Have":**
- Regulatory/legal requirement
- Core user job cannot be completed without it
- Explicitly promised to customers
- Security or data integrity requirement

**Common Mistakes:**
- Everything becomes "Must Have" (scope creep)
- Not documenting "Won't Have" items
- Treating "Should Have" as optional (they're important)
- Forgetting to revisit for next release

---

### ICE Scoring

**Formula:**
```
ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3
```

| Component | Scale | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Impact** | 1-10 | Expected effect on key metric |
| **Confidence** | 1-10 | How sure are you about impact? |
| **Ease** | 1-10 | How easy to implement? |

**When to Use ICE vs RICE:**
- ICE: Early-stage exploration, quick estimates
- RICE: Quarterly planning, cross-team prioritization

---

### Kano Model

Categories of feature satisfaction:

| Type | Absent | Present | Priority |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Basic (Must-Be)** | Dissatisfied | Neutral | High - table stakes |
| **Performance (Linear)** | Neutral | Satisfied proportionally | Medium - differentiation |
| **Excitement (Delighter)** | Neutral | Very satisfied | Strategic - competitive edge |
| **Indifferent** | Neutral | Neutral | Low - skip unless cheap |
| **Reverse** | Satisfied | Dissatisfied | Avoid - remove if exists |

**Feature Classification Questions:**
1. How would you feel if the product HAS this feature?
2. How would you feel if the product DOES NOT have this feature?

---

## Discovery Frameworks

### Customer Interview Guide

**Structure (35 minutes total):**

```
1. CONTEXT QUESTIONS (5 min)
   â””â”€â”€ Build rapport, understand role

2. PROBLEM EXPLORATION (15 min)
   â””â”€â”€ Dig into pain points

3. SOLUTION VALIDATION (10 min)
   â””â”€â”€ Test concepts if applicable

4. WRAP-UP (5 min)
   â””â”€â”€ Referrals, follow-up
```

**Detailed Script:**

#### Phase 1: Context (5 min)
```
"Thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in..."

- What's your role and how long have you been in it?
- Walk me through a typical day/week.
- What tools do you use for [relevant task]?
```

#### Phase 2: Problem Exploration (15 min)
```
"I'd love to understand the challenges you face with [area]..."

- What's the hardest part about [task]?
- Can you tell me about the last time you struggled with this?
- What did you do? What happened?
- How often does this happen?
- What does it cost you (time, money, frustration)?
- What have you tried to solve it?
- Why didn't those solutions work?
```

#### Phase 3: Solution Validation (10 min)
```
"Based on what you've shared, I'd like to get your reaction to an idea..."

[Show prototype/concept - keep it rough to invite honest feedback]

- What's your initial reaction?
- How does this compare to what you do today?
- What would prevent you from using this?
- How much would this be worth to you?
- Who else would need to approve this purchase?
```

#### Phase 4: Wrap-up (5 min)
```
"This has been incredibly helpful..."

- Anything else I should have asked?
- Who else should I talk to about this?
- Can I follow up if I have more questions?
```

**Interview Best Practices:**
- Never ask "would you use this?" (people lie about future behavior)
- Ask about past behavior: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Embrace silence - count to 7 before filling gaps
- Watch for emotional reactions (pain = opportunity)
- Record with permission; take minimal notes during

### Hypothesis Template

**Format:**
```
We believe that [building this feature/making this change]
For [target user segment]
Will [achieve this measurable outcome]

We'll know we're right when [specific metric moves by X%]

We'll know we're wrong when [falsification criteria]
```

**Example:**
```
We believe that adding saved payment methods
For returning customers
Will increase checkout completion rate

We'll know we're right when checkout completion increases by 15%

We'll know we're wrong when completion rate stays flat after 2 weeks
or saved payment adoption is < 20%
```

**Hypothesis Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Specific user segment defined
- [ ] Measurable outcome (number, not "better")
- [ ] Timeframe for measurement
- [ ] Clear falsification criteria
- [ ] Based on evidence (interviews, data)

### Opportunity Solution Tree

**Structure:**
```
[DESIRED OUTCOME]
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ Opportunity 1: [User problem/need]
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution A
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution B
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Experiment: [Test to validate]
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ Opportunity 2: [User problem/need]
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Solution C
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Solution D
        â”‚
        â””â”€â”€ Opportunity 3: [User problem/need]
            â””â”€â”€ Solution E
```

**Example:**
```
[Increase monthly active users by 20%]
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ Users forget to return
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Weekly email digest
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mobile push notifications
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Test: A/B email frequency
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ New users don't find value quickly
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Improved onboarding wizard
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Personalized first experience
        â”‚
        â””â”€â”€ Users churn after free trial
            â”œâ”€â”€ Extended trial for engaged users
            â””â”€â”€ Friction audit of upgrade flow
```

**Process:**
1. Start with measurable outcome (not solution)
2. Map opportunities from user research
3. Generate multiple solutions per opportunity
4. Design small experiments to validate
5. Prioritize based on learning potential

                           ^   ^
                           |   |
              Anxiety of   |   |   Habit of
              change â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜   â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ status quo
```

**Interview Questions for JTBD:**
- When did you first realize you needed something like this?
- What were you using before? Why did you switch?
- What almost prevented you from switching?
- What would make you go back to the old way?

## Metrics Frameworks

### North Star Metric Framework

**Criteria for a Good NSM:**
1. **Measures value delivery**: Captures what users get from product
2. **Leading indicator**: Predicts business success
3. **Actionable**: Teams can influence it
4. **Measurable**: Trackable on regular cadence

**Examples by Business Type:**

| Business | North Star Metric | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Spotify | Time spent listening | Measures engagement value |
| Airbnb | Nights booked | Core transaction metric |
| Slack | Messages sent in channels | Team collaboration value |
| Dropbox | Files stored/synced | Storage utility delivered |
| Netflix | Hours watched | Entertainment value |

**Supporting Metrics Structure:**
```
[NORTH STAR METRIC]
        â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ Breadth: How many users?
        â”œâ”€â”€ Depth: How engaged are they?
        â””â”€â”€ Frequency: How often do they engage?
```

---

### HEART Framework

| Metric | Definition | Example Signals |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Happiness** | Subjective satisfaction | NPS, CSAT, survey scores |
| **Engagement** | Depth of involvement | Session length, actions/session |
| **Adoption** | New user behavior | Signups, feature activation |
| **Retention** | Continued usage | D7/D30 retention, churn rate |
| **Task Success** | Efficiency & effectiveness | Completion rate, time-on-task, errors |

**Goals-Signals-Metrics Process:**
1. **Goal**: What user behavior indicates success?
2. **Signal**: How would success manifest in data?
3. **Metric**: How do we measure the signal?

**Example:**
```
Feature: New checkout flow

Goal: Users complete purchases faster
Signal: Reduced time in checkout, fewer drop-offs
Metrics:
  - Median checkout time (target: <2 min)
  - Checkout completion rate (target: 85%)
  - Error rate (target: <2%)
```

| **Revenue** | Conversion rate, ARPU, LTV | 2-5% freeâ†’paid |
| **Referral** | NPS, viral coefficient, referrals/user | NPS > 50 is excellent |

**Analysis Framework:**
1. Map current conversion rates at each stage
2. Identify biggest drop-off point
3. Qualitative research: Why are users leaving?
4. Hypothesis: What would improve conversion?
5. Test and measure

## Strategic Frameworks

### Product Vision Template

**Format:**
```
FOR [target customer]
WHO [statement of need or opportunity]
THE [product name] IS A [product category]
THAT [key benefit, compelling reason to use]
UNLIKE [primary competitive alternative]
OUR PRODUCT [statement of primary differentiation]
```

**Example:**
```
FOR busy professionals
WHO need to stay informed without information overload
Briefme IS A personalized news digest
THAT delivers only relevant stories in 5 minutes
UNLIKE traditional news apps that require active browsing
OUR PRODUCT learns your interests and filters automatically
```

### Competitive Analysis Framework

| Dimension | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|-----------|----|--------------|--------------|
| **Target User** | | | |
| **Core Value Prop** | | | |
| **Pricing** | | | |
| **Key Features** | | | |
| **Strengths** | | | |
| **Weaknesses** | | | |
| **Market Position** | | | |

**Strategic Questions:**
1. Where do we have parity? (table stakes)
