## FDA Pathway Selection

Determine the appropriate FDA regulatory pathway based on device classification and predicate availability.

### Decision Framework

```
Predicate device exists?
â”œâ”€â”€ YES â†’ Substantially equivalent?
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YES â†’ 510(k) Pathway
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ No design changes â†’ Abbreviated 510(k)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Manufacturing only â†’ Special 510(k)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Design/performance â†’ Traditional 510(k)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NO â†’ PMA or De Novo
â””â”€â”€ NO â†’ Novel device?
    â”œâ”€â”€ Low-to-moderate risk â†’ De Novo
    â””â”€â”€ High risk (Class III) â†’ PMA
```

### Pathway Comparison

| Pathway | When to Use | Timeline | Cost |
|---------|-------------|----------|------|
| 510(k) Traditional | Predicate exists, design changes | 90 days | $21,760 |
| 510(k) Special | Manufacturing changes only | 30 days | $21,760 |
| 510(k) Abbreviated | Guidance/standard conformance | 30 days | $21,760 |
| De Novo | Novel, low-moderate risk | 150 days | $134,676 |
| PMA | Class III, no predicate | 180+ days | $425,000+ |

### Pre-Submission Strategy

1. Identify product code and classification
2. Search 510(k) database for predicates
3. Assess substantial equivalence feasibility
4. Prepare Q-Sub questions for FDA
5. Schedule Pre-Sub meeting if needed

**Reference:** See [fda_submission_guide.md](references/fda_submission_guide.md) for pathway decision matrices and submission requirements.

## 510(k) Submission Process

### Workflow

```
Phase 1: Planning
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 1: Identify predicate device(s)
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 2: Compare intended use and technology
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 3: Determine testing requirements
â””â”€â”€ Checkpoint: SE argument feasible?

Phase 2: Preparation
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 4: Complete performance testing
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 5: Prepare device description
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 6: Document SE comparison
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 7: Finalize labeling
â””â”€â”€ Checkpoint: All required sections complete?

Phase 3: Submission
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 8: Assemble submission package
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 9: Submit via eSTAR
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 10: Track acknowledgment
â””â”€â”€ Checkpoint: Submission accepted?

Phase 4: Review
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 11: Monitor review status
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 12: Respond to AI requests
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 13: Receive decision
â””â”€â”€ Verification: SE letter received?
```

### Required Sections (21 CFR 807.87)

| Cover Letter | Submission type, device ID, contact info |
| Form 3514 | CDRH premarket review cover sheet |
| Device Description | Physical description, principles of operation |
| Indications for Use | Form 3881, patient population, use environment |
| SE Comparison | Side-by-side comparison with predicate |
| Performance Testing | Bench, biocompatibility, electrical safety |
| Software Documentation | Level of concern, hazard analysis (IEC 62304) |

### Common RTA Issues

| Issue | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Missing user fee | Verify payment before submission |
| Incomplete Form 3514 | Review all fields, ensure signature |
| No predicate identified | Confirm K-number in FDA database |
| Inadequate SE comparison | Address all technological characteristics |

---

## QSR Compliance

Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820) requirements for medical device manufacturers.

### Key Subsystems

| Section | Title | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 820.20 | Management Responsibility | Quality policy, org structure, management review |
| 820.30 | Design Controls | Input, output, review, verification, validation |
| 820.40 | Document Controls | Approval, distribution, change control |
| 820.50 | Purchasing Controls | Supplier qualification, purchasing data |
| 820.70 | Production Controls | Process validation, environmental controls |
| 820.100 | CAPA | Root cause analysis, corrective actions |
| 820.181 | Device Master Record | Specifications, procedures, acceptance criteria |

### Design Controls Workflow (820.30)

```
Step 1: Design Input
â””â”€â”€ Capture user needs, intended use, regulatory requirements
    Verification: Inputs reviewed and approved?

Step 2: Design Output
â””â”€â”€ Create specifications, drawings, software architecture
    Verification: Outputs traceable to inputs?

Step 3: Design Review
â””â”€â”€ Conduct reviews at each phase milestone
    Verification: Review records with signatures?

Step 4: Design Verification
â””â”€â”€ Perform testing against specifications
    Verification: All tests pass acceptance criteria?

Step 5: Design Validation
â””â”€â”€ Confirm device meets user needs in actual use conditions
    Verification: Validation report approved?

Step 6: Design Transfer
â””â”€â”€ Release to production with DMR complete
    Verification: Transfer checklist complete?
```

### CAPA Process (820.100)

1. **Identify**: Document nonconformity or potential problem
2. **Investigate**: Perform root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
3. **Plan**: Define corrective/preventive actions
4. **Implement**: Execute actions, update documentation
5. **Verify**: Confirm implementation complete
6. **Effectiveness**: Monitor for recurrence (30-90 days)
7. **Close**: Management approval and closure

**Reference:** See [qsr_compliance_requirements.md](references/qsr_compliance_requirements.md) for detailed QSR implementation guidance.
